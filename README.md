2. customerService

* each running NodeJS / Express API
* handle biz & logic concerns

And **2 BFFs** (backend-for-frontends)

1. bookBFF
2. customerBFF

* each running a Python server
* handle header parsing, auth, and response transformations

* All the services are deployed via Docker (Dockerfiles provided in reach respective directory)
  * See the [setup script](vmSetup.sh) for help with a docker deployment
* A `Vagrantfile` & `vmSetup.sh` scripts are provided for setting up a development env in a VM
  * Install `Vagrant` & `VirtualBox`
  * run `vagrant up` to start the VM
